You‚Äôre not necessarily selling it person to person with a big stock- algos are buying it back and forth thousands of times a second or at the very least it‚Äôs part of different ETFs and indexes so the stock is automatically bought by those. \\n\\nSo as soon as you sell a stock, it‚Äôs taken from you and matched with the best sale price determined by the open purchase orders. \\n\\nUnlisted OTC penny stocks are different- you have to wait until there is a buyer who wants to buy those shares. Which means that you run the risk of trying to sell and no one‚Äôs buying and the value of your shares evaporates as you wait for a buyer. \\n\\nExercising options makes sense if 1) you want to hold 100 (or more) shares or 2) if you can sell those shares for more than the cost of 100 shares and 100 x premium price. \\n\\nOtherwise you‚Äôre better just trading options to profit on the premiums. \\n\\nSqueeze schqueeze I personally don‚Äôt think that dog hunts but theoretically, the more shares are held and not being sold, the higher the price goes. But more often price is driven up by massive institutional/algo trading. Like, yesterday is a great example. GME skyrocketed due to a few massive identical transactions. Someone posted it here- it was like 2x 917k shares back to back and that just propeled the stock vertical. \\n\\nBut then again, I‚Äôm cynical and highly question retail‚Äôs affect on a market where algos trade back and forth 10s of thousands of shares per second.

Or you stumbling down the stairs half asleep in your boxers in the dark?  Everyone is a badass until the gun is pointed back at them.  Get a shotgun with a huge light on it.  And mad locks and cameras.  And a dog.  The gun alone won't save you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "31  There will always be a buyer for listed stocks. You‚Äôre not necessarily selling it person to person with a big stock- algos are buying it back and forth thousands of times a second or at the very least it‚Äôs part of different ETFs and indexes so the stock is automatically bought by those. \\n\\nSo as soon as you sell a stock, it‚Äôs taken from you and matched with the best sale price determined by the open purchase orders. \\n\\nUnlisted OTC penny stocks are different- you have to wait until there is a buyer who wants to buy those shares. Which means that you run the risk of trying to sell and no one‚Äôs buying and the value of your shares evaporates as you wait for a buyer. \\n\\nExercising options makes sense if 1) you want to hold 100 (or more) shares or 2) if you can sell those shares for more than the cost of 100 shares and 100 x premium price. \\n\\nOtherwise you‚Äôre better just trading options to profit on the premiums. \\n\\nSqueeze schqueeze I personally don‚Äôt think that dog hunts but theoretically, the more shares are held and not being sold, the higher the price goes. But more often price is driven up by massive institutional/algo trading. Like, yesterday is a great example. GME skyrocketed due to a few massive identical transactions. Someone posted it here- it was like 2x 917k shares back to back and that just propeled the stock vertical. \\n\\nBut then again, I‚Äôm cynical and highly question retail‚Äôs affect on a market where algos trade back and forth 10s of thousands of shares per second. But I‚Äôm an idiot who doesn‚Äôt know anything so take what I say with a grain of salt. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   \n",

       "37  Prayers for you and your Dad, Stress is a killer. Blessed with two sons like you! My x left after 25 years. Two boys in college and my bird dog died. Stress gave me cancer, beat it. Like a country song. I was 50 then. It almost ruined me but I am back. Finally forgave her and get to hunt and fish all I want. The moon is the limit! \\nKeep your chin up! Love, another Dad in NC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "38  Yeah ever since people have called this out and ever since the gme trained started my port has been absolutely dog shit. Every good fundamental sentiment and value all went out the window and now every stock is practically a contract with a lifetime could go up could go down could rip or could absolutely dip.
